# project

## We are using elasticbeanstalk for Laravel API and ec2 for nextjs frontend. The issue is with authorization header. From localhost authorization header is working fine. But from ec2 server authorization header is not attaching. Nginx is running on elasticeanstalk. We have to fix this.
## I want to discuss further more details.
